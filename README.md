Xamarin Tesseract OCR binding for iOS
=====================================


DEPRECATED - This is an old binding against an old version of Tesseract OCR for iOS. Please use https://github.com/jherby2k/Xamarin-Tesseract-OCR-iOS-Unified as this is the maintained version. The master branch has not been updated for Unified API support, but the 'unified-api' branch has been and will be kept for reference purposes.

About
-----

Xamarin-Tesseract-OCR-iOS is an Xamarin binding for [Tesseract OCR](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).

This could not exist without [Alex Soto](https://github.com/dalexsoto), who has done all the hard work creating the binding project & static lib in response to [This Xamarin forum question](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/3673/help-adding-tesseract-as-a-ios-binding-project).

The binding itself is the Tesseract.iOS project. This repository also contains Tesseract.iOS-Sample project, to show the most basic usage of this library in an iOS application.

Please feel free to contribute/improve on this binding :).
